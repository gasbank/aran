		 careful and deliberate manipulation of contact forces.
		 The variation in contact configuration (e.g., standing
		 on one foot, on uneven ground, or while holding on for
		 support) presents a difficult challenge for interactive
		 simulation of humans and animals, especially while
		 performing tasks in the presence of external
		 disturbances. We describe an analytic approach for
		 control of standing in three-dimensional simulations
		 based upon local optimization. At any point in time,
		 the control system solves a quadratic program to
		 compute actuation by maximizing the performance of
		 multiple motion objectives subject to constraints
		 imposed by actuation limits and contact configuration.
		 This formulation is suitable for interactive animation
		 and it adapts to the proportions of any character model
		 in any non-planar, frictional contact configuration.",

		 is difficult to do well. Many graphics applications
		 demand that we be able to compute and differentiate
		 positions and orientations of articulated figures with
		 respect to their rotational (and other) parameters, as
		 well as integrate differential equations, optimize
		 rotation parameters, and interpolate orientations.
		 Widely used parameterizations such as Euler angles and
		 quaternions are well suited to only a few of these
		 operations. The exponential map maps a vector in $R^3$
		 describing the axis and magnitude of a three-DOF
		 rotation to the corresponding rotation. Several
		 graphics researchers have applied it with limited
		 success to interpolation of orientations, but it has
		 been virtually ignored with respect to the other
		 operations mentioned above. In this paper we present
		 formulae for computing, differentiating, and
		 integrating three-DOF rotations with the exponential
		 map. We show that our formulation is numerically stable
		 in the face of machine precision issues, and that for
		 most applications all singularities in the map can be
		 avoided through a simple technique of dynamic
		 reparameterization. We demonstrate how to use the
		 exponential map to solve both the ``freely rotating
		 body'' problem and the important ball-and-socket joint
		 required to accurately model shoulder and hip joints in
		 articulated figures. Examining several common graphics
		 applications, we explain the benefits of our
		 formulation of the exponential map over Euler angles
		 and quaternions, including robustness, small state
		 vectors, lack of explicit constraints, good modeling
		 capabilities, simplicity of solving ordinary
		 differential equations, and good interpolation
		 behavior.",

To better understand both the direct and indirect effects of the APF during push-off and through advancement of the leg, mechanical work and inverse dynamic analyses were performed on 8 normal subjects during level walking. During push-off, 23.1 joules (J) of energy were generated, primarily by the APF, but only 4.2 J of this energy is transferred into the trunk. Ankle plantar flexor work is primarily used to accelerate the leg into swing. Most of the energy, 18.6 J, is recovered by transfer into the trunk at the end of swing. The timing of the energy transfers relative to the trunk motion imply that the APF contributes to the forward kinetic energy of the trunk but that other mechanisms likely account for the work used to raise the trunk against gravity.},

    abstract = {A three-dimensional model of the human body is used to simulate a maximal vertical jump. The body is modeled as a 10-segment, 23 degree-of-freedom (dof), mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. Six generalized coordinates describe the position and orientation of the pelvis relative to the ground; the remaining nine segments branch in an open chain from the pelvis. The head, arms, and torso (HAT) are modeled as a single rigid body. The HAT articulates with the pelvis via a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint. Each hip is modeled as a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint, and each knee is modeled as a 1 dof hinge joint. Each foot is represented by a hindfoot and toes segment. The hindfoot articulates with the shank via a 2 dof universal joint, and the toes articulate with the hindfoot via a 1 dof hinge joint. Interaction of the feet with the ground is modeled using a series of spring-damper units placed under the sole of each foot. The path of each muscle is represented by either a series of straight lines or a combination of straight lines and space curves. Each actuator is modeled as a three-element, Hill-type muscle in series with tendon. A first-order process is assumed to model muscle excitation-contraction dynamics. Dynamic optimization theory is used to calculate the pattern of muscle excitations that produces a maximal vertical jump. Quantitative comparisons between model and experiment indicate that the model reproduces the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle-coordination patterns evident when humans jump to their maximum achievable heights.},

  abstract =	". A linear complementarity formulation for dynamic
		 multi-rigid-body contact problems with Coulomb friction
		 is presented. The formulation, based on explicit Euler
		 integration and polygonal approximation of the friction
		 cone, is guaranteed to have a solution for any number
		 of contacts and contact configuration. A model with the
		 same property is formulated for impact problems with
		 friction and nonzero elasticity coefficient. An
		 explicit Euler scheme based on these formulations is
		 presented and is proved to have uniformly bounded
		 velocities as the stepsize tends to zero for the
		 Newton-Euler formulation in body coordinates. Key
		 words: Impacts with friction, multi-body dynamics,
		 complementarity problems, contact constraints. 1.
		 Introduction Dynamic multi-rigid-body contact problems
		 arise in several research areas, especially robotics
		 and virtual reality. They are concerned essentially
		 with modeling the dynamic behavior of several rigid
		 bodies in contact. The usual approach in treating
